                <h3>LSU Enterprise</h3>
                <p>My primary role was to generate ideas for events and activities in LSU Enterprise as well as
                    preparing and hosting them.
                <ul>
                    <li>Advised students on their business ideas and what they could improve.</li>
                    <li>Served as a consulting member of the committee.</li>
                    <li>Created and hosted my own event “Computer Science x LSU Enterprise Talent Match”, to facilitate
                        connections
                        between student entrepreneurs and prospective developers. This event won the event of the year
                        in Enterprise.</li>

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed an internal wiki page discussing a specific storage system for Amazon Fulfilment
                        Centres (FCs) and
                        expanded on the associated documentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Evaluated project management tools for our team and customers to use, this involved building out
                        customer
                        profiles and stakeholder requirements specification.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created a Tableau dashboard with the aid of SQL which covered the fundamental metrics for
                        Fulfilment Centres
                        (FCs) across the EU and North America regions from a network level overview all the way down to
                        zones within
                        each FC. This aided later data analysis to optimise the FCs and networks and find previously
                        unseen problems.</p>
